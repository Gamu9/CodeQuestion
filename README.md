# CodeQuestion

Background

SoftSort is a company that wants to provide a sorting library for its users to test the suitability of various sorting algorithms.
The library will sort a given input using all the implemented algorithms and return the sorted data. 
In addition it will record the time each algorithm took to sort the input.
This will allow users to know which algorithm works best based on their data.
The company currently supports two algorithms but more will added later. However, adding the actual algorithms is out of scope for this execise.

Your task

The initial version was written very quickly to beat a competitor to the market.
As a result the owners of the company are concerned that the code may not be using good coding practices and techniques.
They hire you as an outside consultant to refactor the library and use best practices.

Guidelines

Use purity over pragmatism for any design decisions that may be contentious. 
Favour good practice over performance for this exercise.
Feel free to comment your code where neccessary.
Make note of issues you have found and how you solved them for discussion points in your interview.
DO NOT use 3rd party libraries to solve design patterns. Write your own code to illustrate concepts as far as possible.
Try NOT to use .net framework objects to solve problems, rather use the c# language functionality to illustrate your understanding of concepts.
